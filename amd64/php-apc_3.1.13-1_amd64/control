Description: APC (Alternative PHP Cache) module for PHP 5
 The Alternative PHP Cache, also known as APC, is a free, open, and robust
 framework for caching and optimizing PHP intermediate code. APC is a fast
 solution for caching PHP code locally, it is not distributed like MemcacheD,
 but they can be used together for optimal caching.
