Description: server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (metapackage)
 This package is a metapackage that, when installed, guarantees that you

 it may remove other packages that depend on this one.

 PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used
 open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited
 for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
