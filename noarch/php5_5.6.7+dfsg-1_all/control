Description: server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (metapackage)
 This package is a metapackage that, when installed, guarantees that you

 installed. Removing this package won't remove PHP5 from your system, however
 it may remove other packages that depend on this one.

 PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used
 open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited
 for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
