Description: PEAR - PHP Extension and Application Repository
 This package contains the base PEAR classes for PHP, as well as the PEAR
 installer.  Many PEAR classes are already packaged for Debian, and can be
 easily identified by names beginning with "php-", such as php-db and
 php-auth.  Note: to build and install precompiled PECL extensions, you
 will need one of the php development packages installed.
 .
 PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used
 open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited
 for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
