Description: Cyrus SASL extension for PHP 5
 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (as defined by
 RFC 2222).  It provides a system for adding plugable authenticating
 support to connection-based protocols.  The SASL Extension for PHP
 makes the Cyrus SASL library functions available to PHP. It aims to
 provide a 1-to-1 wrapper around the SASL library to provide the
 greatest amount of implementation flexibility.  To that end, it is
 possible to build both a client-side and server-side SASL
 implementation entirely in PHP.
